              <p class="card-text" >Kollam refers to the eastern, mainland portion of the twin cities of Ernakulam-Kochi in central Kerala, India. Located on the coast of the Arabian Sea, Ernakulam is a booming business metropolis. It is often referred to as the commercial capital of Kerala. Ernakulam has been a part of human settlements since the Stone Age. Rock-cut caves and dolmens are still a part of this city. Ernakulam was ruled by the Chera Dynasty and later, by the Kingdom of Cochin (Perumpadapu Swaroopam).
              The main tourist attractions in Ernakulam are the Hill Palace Museum, Madhavan Nayar Foundation, Kaladi, Kodanad, Chendamangalam, Malayatoor, Bhoothathankettu and Thattekkad Bird Sanctuary. Being home to numerous temples and churches, Ernakulam is a favorite among domestic tourists visiting Kerala.</p>
